# Assignment 1 — Onboarding: Workstation Setup, Standards & AI (Go Beyond)

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) Cohort 3 with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will set up a production-ready Ansible development workstation following real-world team standards: an isolated Python environment, VS Code tooling, SSH readiness, Git hygiene, pre-commit hooks, and reproducible onboarding documentation.

---

# Task 1 — Environment & Ansible Install

## Goal

Create and activate an isolated `.venv` inside `ansible-onboarding/`, install `ansible`, `ansible-lint`, and `yamllint`, and save dependencies to `requirements.txt`.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — Terminal showing the activated `.venv` and successful `ansible --version` output

#### Screenshot 2 — Terminal showing successful `ansible-lint --version` output and `requirements.txt`

# Task 2 — VS Code Setup (Tooling That Teams Expect)

## Goal

Install the Ansible, YAML, and Python VS Code extensions, and create `.vscode/settings.json` and `.editorconfig` with the team-standard settings.

### Evidence

# Task 3 — Baseline ansible.cfg (Team-Friendly Defaults)

## Goal

Create `ansible.cfg` in the project root with the team-friendly defaults and SSH connection settings, and confirm Ansible reads it.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 5 — VS Code or terminal showing `ansible.cfg` in the project root with the supplied settings

# Task 4 — SSH Readiness (Enterprise Basics)

## Goal

Generate or use an Ed25519 SSH key, load it into `ssh-agent`, and configure `~/.ssh/config` with safe defaults.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 6 — Terminal showing `ssh-add -l` with the key loaded (do not expose private-key contents)

# Task 5 — Git Identity, Signing & Hooks

## Goal

Configure Git identity and the `main` default branch, install `pre-commit`, add `.pre-commit-config.yaml` with `yamllint` and `ansible-lint` hooks, and run the hooks as a smoke test.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 7 — Terminal showing `pre-commit install` output

#### Screenshot 8 — Terminal showing `pre-commit run --all-files` passing

# Task 6 — README + Checklist

## Goal

Document the workstation setup in `README.md`, including a "New Machine? Do This" checklist with 10–12 bullet points.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 9 — Repository tree showing the required files

### Notes

State one thing that makes this setup team-friendly, and one pitfall you avoided (e.g. global pip, missing SSH agent). Note any corporate proxy or CA certificate steps, if applicable.

Write your answer here.
