# Assignment 2 — Deploy a Virtual Machine on AWS with Public Network Using Terraform

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) Cohort 3 with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will use Terraform to create a custom AWS network (VPC, public and private subnets, Internet Gateway, route table) and launch an EC2 instance into the public subnet with a public IP, a Security Group allowing SSH and HTTP, and Nginx installed for validation.

# Task 1 — Create a New Terraform Project

## Goal

Create a `terraform-aws-vm` project directory for the AWS Terraform configuration.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — File Explorer, VS Code, or terminal showing the `terraform-aws-vm` project directory

# Task 2 — Create main.tf with the Required AWS Resources

## Goal

Define the AWS provider, a VPC (10.0.0.0/16) with a public subnet (10.0.1.0/24) and private subnet (10.0.2.0/24), an Internet Gateway with public routing, a Security Group (SSH 22, HTTP 80), an EC2 instance in the public subnet with a public IP, and a public IP output.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 2 (optional) — `main.tf` showing the VPC and EC2 resource blocks

# Task 3 — Initialize Terraform

## Goal

Run `terraform init` and confirm the working directory initializes successfully.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 3 — Terminal showing successful `terraform init` output

---

# Task 4 — Plan and Apply the Configuration

## Goal

Review `terraform plan`, run `terraform apply`, and record the EC2 instance's public IP from the Terraform output.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 4 — Terraform apply output showing successful completion

#### Screenshot 5 — Terraform output showing the EC2 public IP

---

# Task 5 — Verify the Deployment

## Goal

Confirm the EC2 instance is running in the public subnet with a public IP, install Nginx, and confirm it is accessible by browser or SSH.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 6 — EC2 instance running in the AWS Console, with the subnet and public IP visible

---

#### Screenshot 7 — Browser showing the Nginx page through the EC2 public IP, or terminal showing a successful SSH connection

---

# Task 6 — Destroy Resources

## Goal

Run `terraform destroy` to remove the Terraform-managed AWS resources after testing.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 8 — Terminal showing successful `terraform destroy` completion

### Notes

Write a short paragraph about any challenges you faced and how you solved them.

The main challenge was the credential error from the pasted Terraform output. The AWS provider had no usable credentials. The default profile is an aws login session for the account root user, which the provider doesn't read, and the other profiles weren't selected. I confirmed which profiles worked with aws sts get-caller-identity, then ran terraform plan with AWS_PROFILE=dmi-c3-g3-training, which succeeded with 9 resources to add. The second challenge was the push. The Azure work was already merged to origin/main through PR #1, and local main was two commits behind. Your working copy was on an unmerged feature branch, so I committed the AWS files on top of origin/main in a temporary worktree and pushed from there. That left your working copy untouched, but it bypassed the PR review step, which I flagged to you.
