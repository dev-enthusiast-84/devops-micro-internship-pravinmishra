# Assignment 3 — Deploy a React Application on Azure Virtual Machine Using Terraform

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) Cohort 3 with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will use Terraform to provision an Azure resource group, network, and Ubuntu 20.04 VM, then deploy the `my-react-app` React application onto the VM over SSH and serve it through Nginx.

---

# Task 1 — Create a New Terraform Project

## Goal

Create a `terraform-react-azure` project directory for the Azure Terraform configuration.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — File Explorer, VS Code, or terminal showing the `terraform-react-azure` project directory

---

# Task 2 — Write main.tf to Provision the Azure Infrastructure

## Goal

Define the resource group, virtual network/subnet, Network Security Group (SSH 22, HTTP 80), public IP, network interface, and Ubuntu 20.04 Standard B1s VM in `main.tf`.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 2 — VS Code showing `main.tf` with the required Azure resources, with any password or sensitive values hidden

---

# Task 3 — Initialize Terraform

## Goal

Run `terraform init` and confirm the working directory initializes successfully.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 3 — Terminal showing successful `terraform init` output

---

# Task 4 — Plan and Apply the Configuration

## Goal

Review `terraform plan`, run `terraform apply`, and record the VM's public IP.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 4 — Terraform apply output showing successful completion

# Task 5 — Connect to the Virtual Machine

## Goal

Establish an SSH session with the Ubuntu VM through its public IP.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 6 — Terminal showing a successful SSH connection to the Azure VM

---

# Task 6 — Install Node.js, npm, and Git

## Goal

Update Ubuntu and install Node.js, npm, and Git.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 7 — Terminal showing successful installation and the `node -v` and `npm -v` output

# Task 7 — Clone, Build, and Serve the React App with Nginx

## Goal

Follow the `my-react-app` repository README to clone, install, and build the app, then serve the production build through Nginx.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 8 — Terminal showing the successful React build

---

#### Screenshot 9 — Terminal showing that Nginx is active and running

---

# Task 8 — Test the Deployment

## Goal

Confirm the React application loads through the VM's public IP and navigation works.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 10 — Browser showing the React application with the Azure VM public IP visible in the address bar

### Notes

Write a short summary of what you built and any issues you encountered and how you resolved them.

What I built

I added a Terraform configuration in terraform-react-azure/ that provisions an Ubuntu 22.04 VM on Azure. On first boot, setup-react.sh (passed as custom_data) installs Node.js 20 and Nginx, clones my-react-app, builds it, and serves it on port 80. The config also creates the resource group, VNet, subnet, static public IP, NIC and an NSG that allows SSH and HTTP. 

Issues and fixes

- SSH host key warning after recreating the VM. Re-running terraform apply created a new VM with a new host key, so SSH refused to connect because of the old entry in ~/.ssh/known_hosts. The fix is to confirm the new fingerprint against Azure and then run ssh-keygen -R <public_ip>. I documented this step in the README.
- Password handling. The admin password is a sensitive variable with no default and is supplied through TF_VAR_admin_password, so it isn't stored in source control.
