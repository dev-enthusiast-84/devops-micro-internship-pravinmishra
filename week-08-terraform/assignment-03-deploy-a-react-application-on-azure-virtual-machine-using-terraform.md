# Assignment 3 — Deploy a React Application on Azure Using Terraform

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will use Terraform to provision the required Azure infrastructure and automatically deploy the `my-react-app` React application on an Azure Linux virtual machine using a `cloud-init.sh` deployment script passed to the VM through `custom_data`.

You will verify the automated deployment through SSH, confirm that Nginx is running, access the React application through the VM public IP, and destroy the Terraform-managed resources after testing.

---

**FLAG (task change):** Your submitted version used a manual deployment: you installed Node.js, Git, and built the React app over SSH (old Tasks 5–7). The current upstream task automates this with `cloud-init.sh` passed through `custom_data`. Your old manual evidence is kept below only where it still fits a current slot. Your Notes paragraph also refers to `setup-react.sh`, which the current spec calls `cloud-init.sh`. Let's decide together whether to rebuild the automated version or keep the manual steps.

---

# Task 0 — Set Up and Verify the Terraform and Azure CLI Environment

## Goal

Prepare your local environment for Terraform deployment by installing Terraform, Azure CLI, and the HashiCorp Terraform extension in VS Code, signing in to your Azure account, and confirming that all required tools are working correctly.

## Evidence

### Screenshot 1 — Terraform Version

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing successful `terraform version` output.

Add your screenshot here.

**FLAG:** New upstream task. Not in your snapshot.

---

### Screenshot 2 — Azure CLI Version

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing successful `az version` output.

Add your screenshot here.

**FLAG:** New upstream task. Not in your snapshot.

---

### Screenshot 3 — HashiCorp Terraform Extension

Add a screenshot of the VS Code Extensions panel showing the HashiCorp Terraform extension installed and enabled.

Add your screenshot here.

**FLAG:** New upstream task. Not in your snapshot.

# Task 1 — Create a New Terraform Project and Define the Infrastructure

## Goal

Create a new Terraform project and define the complete Azure infrastructure required to host the React application using the official Terraform Registry documentation.

The `terraform-react-azure` project must contain:

```text
terraform-react-azure/
├── main.tf
└── cloud-init.sh
```

The Terraform configuration must include:

- Terraform and AzureRM provider configuration
- Resource group
- Virtual network and subnet
- Network Security Group
- SSH rule for TCP port `22`
- HTTP rule for TCP port `80`
- Public IP address
- Network interface
- Linux virtual machine
- `custom_data` configuration referencing `cloud-init.sh`
- Public IP output

The `cloud-init.sh` file must contain the complete automated React application deployment workflow based on the repository instructions.

## Evidence

### Screenshot 4 — Provider, Resource Group, and Network Security Group

Add a screenshot of VS Code showing the AzureRM provider, resource group, and Network Security Group configuration in `main.tf`.

![Screenshot 2 - main.tf with required Azure resources](screenshots/assignment-03/Screenshot%202.png)

**FLAG:** Your `main.tf` screenshot is kept here. Please confirm it shows the provider, resource group, and NSG.

---

### Screenshot 5 — Linux Virtual Machine and `custom_data`

Add a screenshot of VS Code showing the Linux virtual machine configuration, including the `custom_data` configuration, in `main.tf`.

Ensure that passwords, private keys, account IDs, access tokens, and other sensitive information are hidden.

Add your screenshot here.

**FLAG:** Your snapshot doesn't show `custom_data` configuration. This is new for the automated version.

---

### Screenshot 6 — Completed `cloud-init.sh`

Add a screenshot of VS Code showing the completed `cloud-init.sh` deployment script.

Ensure that no passwords, Azure credentials, access tokens, SSH private keys, or other sensitive information are visible.

Add your screenshot here.

**FLAG:** New upstream file (`cloud-init.sh`). Your deployment script is named `setup-react.sh` in your notes. Not in your snapshot.

---

### Screenshot 7 — Public IP Output Block

Add a screenshot of VS Code showing the public IP `output` block in `main.tf`.

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 2 — Initialize Terraform

## Goal

Initialize the Terraform working directory and download the required provider components.

## Evidence

### Screenshot 8 — Terraform Initialization

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing successful `terraform init` output.

![Screenshot 3 - terraform init](screenshots/assignment-03/Screenshot%203.png)

---

# Task 3 — Plan and Apply the Configuration

## Goal

Review the Terraform execution plan and provision the Azure infrastructure.

## Evidence

### Screenshot 9 — Terraform Plan

Add a screenshot showing the Terraform plan summary and the proposed resources.

Add your screenshot here.

---

### Screenshot 10 — Terraform Apply

Add a screenshot showing successful `terraform apply` completion.

![Screenshot 4 - terraform apply](screenshots/assignment-03/Screenshot%204.png)

---

### Screenshot 11 — VM Public IP Output

Add a screenshot showing the VM public IP address returned by `terraform output`.

Add your screenshot here.

**FLAG:** Your Screenshot 5 in the old version was the Azure portal showing the VM and its public IP. It is not the `terraform output` view that upstream requires. Please add the `terraform output` view.

## VM Public IP Address

Record the public IP address displayed by `terraform output`.

**VM Public IP Address:** Add the VM public IP address here

---

# Task 4 — Verify the Automated Deployment

## Goal

Connect to the Azure Linux virtual machine and confirm that the cloud-init/user data deployment script completed successfully.

## Evidence

### Screenshot 12 — SSH Connection and Completed React Deployment

Add a screenshot of SSH terminal showing successful connection to the Azure VM and evidence that the React application deployment completed such as the deployed files in `/var/www/html` or successful cloud-init output.

![Screenshot 6 - SSH connection](screenshots/assignment-03/Screenshot%206.png)

**FLAG:** Your SSH screenshot is kept. Upstream also expects evidence of automated cloud-init completion, which is not in your snapshot.

---

### Screenshot 13 — Nginx Service Status

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing that the Nginx service is running successfully.

![Screenshot 9 - Nginx status](screenshots/assignment-03/Screenshot%209.png)

---

# Task 5 — Verify the React Application Deployment

## Goal

Confirm that the automatically deployed React application is publicly accessible and functioning correctly.

## Evidence

### Screenshot 14 — React Application in the Browser

Add a screenshot of the browser showing the deployed React application successfully loaded using the Azure VM public IP.

Ensure that the Azure VM public IP is visible in the browser address bar.

# My Earlier Notes (kept as written)

## Notes

Write a short summary of what you built and any issues you encountered and how you resolved them.

What I built

I added a Terraform configuration in terraform-react-azure/ that provisions an Ubuntu 22.04 VM on Azure. On first boot, setup-react.sh (passed as custom_data) installs Node.js 20 and Nginx, clones my-react-app, builds it, and serves it on port 80. The config also creates the resource group, VNet, subnet, static public IP, NIC and an NSG that allows SSH and HTTP. 

Issues and fixes

- SSH host key warning after recreating the VM. Re-running terraform apply created a new VM with a new host key, so SSH refused to connect because of the old entry in ~/.ssh/known_hosts. The fix is to confirm the new fingerprint against Azure and then run ssh-keygen -R <public_ip>. I documented this step in the README.
- Password handling. The admin password is a sensitive variable with no default and is supplied through TF_VAR_admin_password, so it isn't stored in source control.

**FLAG:** Your notes say Ubuntu 22.04, but your original purpose text said 20.04. Also, the setup script name differs (`setup-react.sh` vs `cloud-init.sh`).
